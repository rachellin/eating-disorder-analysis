I have little experience on tumblr so thought it could not be anything bad ro see what it's about... \nI very quickly realised it was an account where she followed and shared eating disorder encouraging posts, thinspo pics and self hating quotes. \nWe've had open communication in the past and in person she seems to be doing so well with her health recently. It confuses me because in person it's all 'more protien eat more and get strong' but her post are about starving  herself and weighing less, and of nearly nude women in extreme deficits. \nI don't know, it's the messages that get me, dudes telling her she looks thin, like a model. And her using her middle name as an alias to talk to them, saying how flatteted she is, and how she really needed that today, yet my daily efforts and compliments get ignored and 'whatevered' I feel like I'm at such a loss and I mean nothing to her anymore because of this horribly toxic environment", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous", "title": "partner relapse, do I intervene?", "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/v7vu9f/partner_relapse_do_i_intervene/"}

I reported their website to cybertip .org, the FBI, and am looking into other avenues w reporting it anonymously to my own local law enforcement agencies. I also appreciate the people who know of or have been members of the site contacting me to offer support and evidence. For all of those people I urge you to report the site as well. The more reports the better.\n\nIt's unlikely that photo of me is going to show up. Part of me was scared that maybe it was just floating around on the forums to this day, but from what I can tell, the site has weirdly transitioned to a celebrity gossip(?) thinspo site.\n\nI really appreciate everyone's help. I have no desire to ever return to that place in my life and honestly I am comforted knowing karma will come for those two in time.\n\nThank you all and I wish everyone here all the best, lots of love", "created": "2022-06-08T16:43:22+00:00", "id": "t1_ibml24b", "parentId": "t3_v793z0", "subreddit": "RBI", "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/v793z0/child_exploitation_proed_website_tw/ibml24b/"}
